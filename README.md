# soundscapenarrative
This is my soundscape narrative. The idea is the first half is an increasingly awful song with interview clips about the "awful" state of modern music - essentially mocking critics by creating the worst thing possible with stock loops. When the awful song reaches a climax, the final beat becomes the sample for the snare in the "amen break" in the following segment. The amen break acts as a connection between older and newer music, as it is used extensively in both. This briefly goes through a chord progression with a clip from the opposite stance: modern music is just fine. Overall, I see this narrative as a reminder to listeners that the common critiques of the modern music industry have little to no substance, and should be ignored for the most part. 

Unfortunately, I am unable to upload the project file. Even when compressed, the file is too large. I have it on a hard drive if needed, but cannot think of any other way to get it into the repo.
